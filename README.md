Coding examples for Pencilcoder curriculum
  
2/28/20 playing around with editors, which led me to Atom, which led me to github.   
I've had an account for years..  perhaps I should migrate my source code here instead
of keeping it on the pencilcode server?  That might be better to add a layer between
"solutions" and students (on the one hand, good to let them have access so they can 
peruse and get inspired etc.  But on the other hand, some tempted to take the shortcut
of copy-paste.)  Also, who knows, I could have better performance while editing which 
could speed up development?  Finally, maybe this is all for naught.  I could also host
on my own server...  This repository really for sharing and collaborating, no?  But 
alas I'm all on my own.
